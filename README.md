# Gold Price Analysis and Forecasting

This project aims to analyze historical gold price data, develop predictive models for forecasting future prices, and formulate trading strategies based on the analysis.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of daily gold prices spanning from January 19, 2014, to January 22, 2024, obtained from Nasdaq. The dataset includes key financial metrics such as opening and closing prices, trading volume, as well as the highest and lowest prices recorded during each trading day.

### Dataset Description

- **Date**: Date of each trading day.
- **Close**: Closing price of gold on the respective date.
- **Volume**: Gold trading volume on the corresponding date.
- **Open**: Opening price of gold on the respective date.
- **High**: The highest recorded price of gold during the trading day.
- **Low**: The lowest price recorded for gold in the trading day.

## Project Objectives

1. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Explore historical trends and patterns in gold prices over the specified time period.
   - Identify seasonality, cyclicality, and long-term trends in the gold market.

2. **Advanced Modeling:**
   - Develop predictive models to forecast future gold prices based on historical data.
   - Evaluate and compare the performance of different forecasting algorithms.

3. **Trading Strategy Development:**
   - Formulate and backtest trading strategies based on the provided price and volume information.
   - Explore the feasibility of trading strategies for profit maximization.

4. **Market Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Investigate the impact of market events on gold prices.
   - Analyze market sentiment and its influence on short-term and long-term price movements.

5. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conduct statistical tests and analyses to understand gold price movements.
   - Explore correlations with external factors and macroeconomic indicators.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/shahram8708/Gold-Price-Analysis-and-Forecasting>
   cd gold_price_analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib
   ```

3. **Place the dataset:**
   - Place the `gold_prices.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

## Running the Project

### Notebooks

- Open and execute each Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb`) in the `notebooks/` directory for different analyses and tasks:
  - `01_time_series_analysis.ipynb`
  - `02_advanced_modeling.ipynb`
  - `03_trading_strategy_development.ipynb`
  - `04_market_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`
  - `05_statistical_analysis.ipynb`

### Scripts

- Alternatively, run individual Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory for automated tasks:
  ```bash
  python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
  python scripts/time_series_analysis.py
  python scripts/advanced_modeling.py
  python scripts/trading_strategy.py
  python scripts/market_sentiment_analysis.py
  python scripts/statistical_analysis.py
  ```

## Results

- Results from analyses and models are saved in the `results/` directory:
  - Visualizations (`time_series_visualizations/`)
  - Predictive models (`predictive_models/`)
  - Trading strategies (`trading_strategies/`)
  - Market sentiment reports (`market_sentiment_reports/`)
  - Statistical analysis reports (`statistical_analysis_reports/`)

## Notes

- Validate the accuracy and reliability of the information and models before making decisions.
- Consider the limitations and biases inherent in financial datasets.
- Acknowledge the impact of external events on gold prices.
